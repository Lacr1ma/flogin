Error Redirects
----------------

    During authentication process some expected errors could occur.
    In this section we mention these errors.

Expired token
===============

    .. rst-class:: horizbuttons-striking-m

    - magic link
    - forgot password

    Usually tokens inside notifications have a certain lifetime.
    That way we can assume the links could be expired when user
    did not use the link in time.

    In such a case system performs redirect to

    .. note::

        :ts:`plugin.tx_login.settings.redirect.error.whenTokenExpiredPage = X`

    .. figure:: ../../Images/Error/token_expired.png
        :class: with-shadow

        Token expired page...

Missing token
===============

    .. rst-class:: horizbuttons-striking-m

    - magic link
    - forgot password

    After the lifetime of the link is passed, - it gets expired, but still exists in the system.
    After certain amount of time scheduler task cleans all the expired links.
    Theoretically, itâ€™s possible that user will face the situation where link has been already deleted.

    In such a case system performs redirect to

    .. note::

        :ts:`plugin.tx_login.settings.redirect.error.whenTokenNotFoundPage = X`

    .. figure:: ../../Images/Error/token_not_found.png
        :class: with-shadow

        Token was deleted page...

Already authenticated
======================

    .. rst-class:: horizbuttons-striking-m

    - magic link

    When user tries to be authenticated thought the magic link, but the active session
    already exists in browser, system performs redirect to

    .. note::

        :ts:`plugin.tx_login.settings.redirect.alreadyAuthenticatedPage = X`

    .. figure:: ../../Images/Error/already_authenticated.png
        :class: with-shadow

        Authenticated page...

User is locked
===============

    .. rst-class:: horizbuttons-striking-m

    - login form

    After brute force targeted to certain account, system usually *locks* the account.
    When someone tries to login using **Login Form**, even if the credentials are correct,
    authentication does not happen when account is locked, instead system performs redirect to

    .. note::

        :ts:`plugin.tx_login.settings.redirect.error.whenLockedPage = X`

    .. figure:: ../../Images/Error/locked.png
        :class: with-shadow

        Locked Page...

    It's worth to mention, that magic link authentication works fine even if the account is locked.
